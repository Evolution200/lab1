CONCLUSION\\nIn summary, we present a quantum algorithm and the\\nrelevant quantum circuit for solving N-variable LDEs, which\\nachieves an exponential speedup O(logN) over its classical\\ncounterpart in certain circumstances. As a proof-of-principledemonstration, we experimentally realize the solution to aset of LDEs with the dimension 4 ×4 in a four-qubit NMR', metadata={'source': '/share/lab4/ych/papers/paper5.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='quantum processor. The experimental solutions to these LDEsare obtained with about 5.36% inﬁdelity. The error mainlycomes from the imperfections of the initial state preparation,the imprecisions and inhomogeneity of the optimized pulses,the decoherence effect, and the readout error in tomography.We numerically simulate each of the above factors to estimatethe error distribution (Appendix G). On average, numerical\\nresults show that the error in state preparation, shaped pulses,decoherence, and readout are 1.07%, 0.84%, 1.19%, and1.23%, respectively. The sum is 4.33% by assuming all errorsare additive, which is slightly smaller than the measured1−¯F.

It indicates theaccuracy of the experimental implementation.\\nUnlike Shor’s or Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algo-\\nrithms where the core is phase estimation, the speedup ofour algorithm comes from the nonunitary [see Eq. ( 2)] to\\nunitary transformation by adding ancillary qubits. It is calledthe linear combination of unitaries (LCU). LCU is alsoa universal subroutine in designing and developing quan-tum algorithms [ 46].

These \\ntasks generally need sequences of search behaviors instead of \\nusing a single query to finish. Thus simply recommending \\nisolated items to users may not adequately satisfy users’ \\nrequirements in terms of task completion.

In detail, the classical query suggestion \\nalgorithms generally use one probability score to measure the \\nrelatedness between two queries [25]. However, there are \\nalways a set of factors that affects the query relatedness, \\nwhich is hard to be modeled by one single measure [15].

RELATED WORK \\nQuery suggestion has attracted much attention in the past \\ndecades [5, 8, 11, 12, and 23]. Much research efforts have \\nbeen paid to the problem of how to discover effective metrics \\nto measure the relationship between queries. Wen et al. [25] \\nidentify four different types of query distances, based on \\nwhich they propose their clustering method for query \\nrecommendation. Zhang et al [27] firstly present a model to \\nconsider the users’ sequential search behavior and introduce \\na dumping factor to measure the similarity between two \\nqueries. Fonseca et al. [11] introduce a method to discover \\nrelated queries based on association rules.

Notice the fact that \\nmany search engine users generally have complicated search \\ntasks that require multiple queries to complete; and most \\nclassical query suggestion algorithms that have focused on \\nsingle-step recommendation rather than multi-step sequence \\nsuggestion will fail to help users in terms of task completion. \\nIn this paper, we propose a two-step method to suggest query sequences for user search task completion. The first step is to \\ngenerate a query relation graph mining from user search log. \\nThe second one is user query prediction based on the query \\ngraph.  \\nThough some stream prediction models [16] employ the \\nassociation between frequent episodes and Hidden Markov', metadata={'source': '/share/lab4/ych/papers/paper7.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Models (HMMs) to predict future occurrences of target \\nevents, they are not designed to distinguish intentions for \\nvarious user groups and thus they are not personalized \\nsolutions. Another group of related work is the Markov \\nRandom walk model, which has been used in various \\napplications by calculating transition probabilities on top of a \\nlinked graph [4, 7, 13, 22, and 28]. Baeza-Yates [2] \\nintroduces five different types of graphs, namely, word graph, \\nsession graph, URL cover graph, URL link graph and link \\ngraph. Levene and Loizou [17] describe a “Hypertext \\nProbabilistic Automata” graph which concentrated on the \\nuser browsing behavior inside a Web site rather than \\nquerying behavior.

These cases show that we can suggest more \\nlogical relatedness sequential queries to help user simplify \\ntheir tasks. For example, in the case of “ sports in Tampa ” in \\nTable IV, we can suggest outdoors, health, restaurant and \\nhotel in Tampa, etc., we can also suggest related tasks about \\nSeattle based on the user search history. In the case of “cheap \\ntickets” in Table V, we can observe the marked improvement \\nof our recommendation system.

But the importance or the ranking of a paper\\nis obscure. A reliable method to evaluate qualities of papers\\nis peer review by experts. Apparently, there is no way of\\nobtaining a fast and objective ranking for a huge amount of\\npapers. In all the rigorous scientiﬁc research papers, there\\nare always some papers or books that are cited as references\\nto supporting the concepts or ideas presented in them [9].\\nThese cited references are very valuable to lead the readers\\nand scholars to the sources of knowledge. Hence citations\\ngive credits to the works in the reference list. Citation in-\\ndices can be used to ﬁnd or select qualitative papers.

A common method is to use ISI\\nJournal Impact Factors [9], which are simply the average ci-\\ntation frequency of articles published in the serial [4]. How-\\never, the impact factor only ranks journals and can hardly\\ngive a reasonable ranking for each individual paper. An-\\nother simple method is to count the number of cited papers,\\nand Garﬁeld [10] suggested that citation data may be useful\\nas quantitative indicators of the impact of particular publi-\\ncations on the literature.

However that a paper is cited more is not the\\nkey. The most important issue is that who cited. The num-\\nber of cited papers for a paper does not consider the status\\nand the prestige of a paper, and so it is easy for being af-\\nfected by some invalid citations.\\nExample 1 Consider a paper by MS Brown and JL Gold-\\nstein published in Science in 1986. Its citation numbers\\n(199) are not very high.

Readers may con-\\nsult [5, 12, 13, 17] for detailed expositions, and [16, 21] for\\ntechniques related. Kleinberg [11] developed another in-\\nteresting model for web mining, called HITS. Lempel and\\nMoran [14] combined the ideas of HITS and PageRank and\\npropose the SALSA algorithm. The web information re-\\ntrieval models, such as PageRank [18] and HITS [11], only\\nuse link structure. Similarly the scientiﬁc publications natu-\\nrally form a network based on the citation relationship. The\\nstandard PageRank and HITS models can be used in pa-\\nper ranking.

Direct and indirect relationships\\nWe classify the relationships between papers as two\\nclasses. One class includes direct citation and cited, co-\\ncitation and co-reference. The other class includes indirect\\ncitation, indirect cited, indirect co-citation, and indirect co-\\nreference. We call the ﬁrst class the direct relationships, and\\ndistinctively call the second class the indirect relationships.\\nWe ﬁrst learn about two simplest direct relationships, i.e.\\ncitation and cited relationships. The direct citation relation-\\nship is deﬁned that one paper cites the other paper (see Fig.', metadata={'source': '/share/lab4/ych/papers/paper8.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='1(a)). Contrastively, if one paper is cited by the other paper,\\nthe relationship is called cited (see Fig. 1(b)).\\nCo-citation and co-reference\\nBesides the above directly citing and cited references of pa-\\npers, we also consider two especial attributes: co-citation\\nand co-reference, which are fundamental metrics to charac-\\nterize the similarity between two documents [11]. If both\\npaper iand paper jare cited by paper k(see Fig. 1(c)), they\\ncan be said as co-citation.
